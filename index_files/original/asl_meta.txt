# Key:
#    SectorPres = Area-average sea level pressure over sector (170-298 E : 60-80 S)
#    ActCenPres = Actual central pressure of ASL
#    lon        = Longitudinal location of ASL (degrees East)
#    lat        = Latitudinal location of ASL
#
# The ASL Relative central pressure can be calculated as follows:
#      RelCenPres[i] = ActCenPres[i] - SectorPres[i]
